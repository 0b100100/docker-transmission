# linuxserver/transmission

Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. Transmission has the features you want from a BitTorrent client: encryption, a web interface, peer exchange, magnet links, DHT, ÂµTP, UPnP and NAT-PMP port forwarding, webseed support, watch directories, tracker editing, global and per-torrent speed limits, and more. [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/about/)

## Usage

```
docker create --name=transmission \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
-v <path to data>:/config \
-v <path to downloads>:/downloads \
-v <path to watch folder>:/watch \
-e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid> \
-p 9091:9091 -p 51413:51413 -p 51413:51413/udp \
linuxserver/transmission
```

**Parameters**

* `-p 9091` 
* `-p 51413` - the port(s)
* `-v /etc/localtime` for timesync - *optional*
* `-v /config` - where transmission should store config files and logs
* `-v /downloads` - local path for downloads
* `-v /watch` - watch folder for torrent files
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on alpine linux with s6 overlay, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it transmission /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

**TL;DR** - The `PGID` and `PUID` values set the user / group you'd like your container to 'run as' to the host OS. This can be a user you've created or even root (not recommended).

Part of what makes our containers work so well is by allowing you to specify your own `PUID` and `PGID`. This avoids nasty permissions errors with relation to data volumes (`-v` flags). When an application is installed on the host OS it is normally added to the common group called users, Docker apps due to the nature of the technology can't be added to this group. So we added this feature to let you easily choose when running your containers.

## Setting up the application 

Webui is on port 9091, the settings.json file in /config has extra settings not available in the webui. Stop the container before editing it or any changes won't be saved.


## Info

* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime `docker logs -f transmission`.
